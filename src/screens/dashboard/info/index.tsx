//learn Object Types - Classes
////TypeScript offers full support for the class keyword introduced in ES2015.

//As with other JavaScript language features, TypeScript adds type annotations and other syntax to allow you to express relationships between classes and other types.

//note What are classes?
//A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
//A template for creating objects.
//Encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
////Classes & Instances
//Objects <===== Classes
////Objects: "The things I'm working with in code"
////Objects: Instances of classes (=bases on classes)
////Objects: Class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals!!
//Classes:   "Blueprints for objects"
//Classes:   Define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have
//Classes:   Classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier

//note Defining classes
//Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, the class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations.

//note What is Object-oriented Programming (OOP)?
//Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects as the primary way of representing data and functionality in a computer program.
//Work with (real-life) Entities in my code

//example Creating a First Class
////Class declarations
//One way to define a class is using a class declaration. To declare a class, you use the class keyword with the name of the class ("Point" here).

// ==>Class Members
//Here's the most basic class - an empty one:
 class //<== Class keyword
 Point //<== Class Name

 //This class isn't very useful yet, so let's start adding some members.
////Fields
//A field declaration creates a public writeable property on a class:
{     //<== class body
  //<===== class field =====>
x: number; //<== property declaration with type annotation
y: number; //<== property aka variable in a class

////Constructors can aka functions
//Class constructors are very similar to functions. You can add parameters with type annotations, default values, and overloads:

//Normal signature with defaults
constructor //<== constructor declaration
(x=10, y=20) //<== constructor parameters with type annotation
{     //<== constructor body
  this.x = x; //<== an "instance" with this. keyword inside
  this.y = y; //<== constructor body
}
/*
class Point {
  //// Overloads
  constructor(x: number, y: string);
  constructor(s: string);
  constructor(xs: any, y?: any) {
    // TBD
  }
}
*/
}

const pt = new Point();
pt.x = 10;
pt.y = 20;

//As with other locations, the type annotation is optional, but will be an implicit any if not specified.

//Fields can also have initializers; these will run automatically when the class is instantiated:

//print 10, 20
console.log(`${pt.x}, ${pt.y}`);

/*
//note Just like with const, let, and var, the initializer of a class property will be used to infer its type:
const pt = new Point();
pt.x = "0"; //<== error
//Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
*/
/*
//important --strictPropertyInitialization
The strictPropertyInitialization setting controls whether class fields need to be initialized in the constructor.

class BadGreeter {
  name: string; //<== error
Property 'name' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.
}
*/
//example
/*
class GoodGreeter {
  name: string;

  constructor() {
    this.name = "hello";
  }
}
*/
//Note that the field needs to be initialized in the constructor itself. TypeScript does not analyze methods you invoke from the constructor to detect initializations, because a derived class might override those methods and fail to initialize the members.
//If you intend to definitely initialize a field through means other than the constructor (for example, maybe an external library is filling in part of your class for you), you can use the definite assignment assertion operator, !:
//example
/*
class OKGreeter {
  // Not initialized, but no error
  name!: string;
}
*/

//note readonly
//Fields may be prefixed with the readonly modifier. This prevents assignments to the field outside of the constructor.
//example
/*
class Greeter {
  readonly name: string = "world";

  constructor(otherName?: string) {
    if (otherName !== undefined) {
      this.name = otherName;
    }
  }

  err() {
    this.name = "not ok";
//Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
  }
}
const g = new Greeter();
g.name = "also not ok";
//Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
*/

//note Constructors
//There are just a few differences between class constructor signatures and function signatures:

// ==>Constructors can't have type parameters - these belong on the outer class declaration, which we'll learn about later

// ==>Constructors can't have return type annotations - the class instance type is always what's returned

//note Super Calls

//Just as in JavaScript, if you have a base class, you'll need to call super(); in your constructor body before using any this. members:
//example
/*
class Base {
  k = 4;
}

class Derived extends Base {
  constructor() {
    // Prints a wrong value in ES5; throws exception in ES6
    console.log(this.k);
////'super' must be called before accessing 'this' in the constructor of a derived class.
    super();
  }
}
//Forgetting to call super is an easy mistake to make in JavaScript, but TypeScript will tell you when itâ€™s necessary.
*/


//learn Define a class And create instance
class Department {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(n: string, a: number) {
    this.name = n;
    this.age = a;
  }
}

const who = new Department('CJ', 20);
console.log(who.name);
console.log(who.age);
console.log(who.name, who.age);
console.log(`${who.name}, ${who.age}` + " is assigned to here.");


//note Methods aka functions in a class
//A function property on a class is called a method. Methods can use all the same type annotations as functions and constructors:
//example
class Methods {
  x = 10;
  y = 10;

  scale(n: number): void {
    this.x *= n;
    this.y *= n;
  }
}
//Other than the standard type annotations, TypeScript doesn't add anything else new to methods.

//note that inside a method body, it is still mandatory to access fields and other methods via this.. An unqualified name in a method body will always refer to something in the enclosing scope:
//example
/*
let x: number = 0;
class C {
  x: string = "hello";

  m() {
    // This is trying to modify 'x' from line 1, not the class property
    x = "world"; //<== error
//Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
  }
}
*/

//learn Method And create instance
class Method {
  x: number = 10; // "=" with value => initialize field
  y: number = 10;

  scale(n: number): void {
    this.x *= n;
    this.y *= n;
  }
}

const style = new Method();
style.scale(20); //<== default values
console.log(style.x, style.y);


//learn Getters/Setters
//Classes can also have accessors:
//example
class GetterSetter {
  _length = 0;
  get length() {
    return this._length;
  }
  set length(value) {
    this._length = value;
  }
}
//important Note that a field-backed get/set pair with no extra logic is very rarely useful in JavaScript. It's fine to expose public fields if you don't need to add additional logic during the get/set operations.

//note TypeScript has some special inference rules for accessors:
// =>If get exists but no set, the property is automatically readonly
// =>If the type of the setter parameter is not specified, it is inferred from the return type of the getter
// =>Getters and setters must have the same Member Visibility

////Since TypeScript 4.3, it is possible to have accessors with different types for getting and setting.
//example
class Thing {
  _size = 0;

  get size(): number {
    return this._size;
  }
  set size(value: string | number | boolean) {
    let num = Number(value);

    // Don't allow NaN, Infinity, etc
    if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {
      this._size = 0;
      return;
    }
    this._size = num;
  }
}

//note Index Signatures
//Classes can declare index signatures; these work the same as Index Signatures for other object types:
//example
class MyClass {
  [s: string]: boolean | ((s: string) => boolean);

  check(s: string) {
    return this[s] as boolean;
  }
}


//note Class Heritage
//Like other languages with object-oriented features, classes in JavaScript can inherit from base classes.

//learn implements Clauses
//You can use an implements clause to check that a class satisfies a particular interface. An error will be issued if a class fails to correctly implement it:

/*
interface Pingable {
  ping(): void;
}

class Sonar implements Pingable {
  ping() {
    console.log("ping!");
  }
}

class Ball implements Pingable { // <== error
//Class 'Ball' incorrectly implements interface 'Pingable'.
  //Property 'ping' is missing in type 'Ball' but required in type 'Pingable'.

  pong() {
    console.log("pong!");
  }
}
*/
//Classes may also implement multiple interfaces, e.g. class C implements A, B {.

////Cautions
//important It's important to understand that an implements clause is only a check that the class can be treated as the interface type. It doesn't change the type of the class or its methods at all. A common source of error is to assume that an implements clause will change the class type - it doesn't!
//example
/*
interface Checkable {
  check(name: string): boolean;
}
class NameChecker implements Checkable {
  check(s) { //<== error
//Parameter 's' implicitly has an 'any' type.
    // Notice no error here
    return s.toLowercse() === "ok";
  }
}
*/
//In above example, we perhaps expected that (s)'s type would be influenced by the name: string parameter of check. It is not - implements clauses don't change how the class body is checked or its type inferred.

//Similarly, implementing an interface with an optional property doesn't create that property:
//example
/*
interface A {
  x: number;
  y?: number;
}
class C implements A {
  x = 0;
}
const c = new C();
c.y = 10; // <== error
//Property 'y' does not exist on type 'C'.
*/

//learn Class can implement interface
interface Pingable {
  ping(): void;
}

class Sonar implements Pingable {
  ping() {
    console.log("ping!");
  }
}

const sonar = new Sonar();
sonar.ping();


//learn extends Clauses
//Class can extend base class
//Classes may extend from a base class. A derived class called "sub-class" has all the properties and methods of its base class, and also define additional members.
//example
class Animal {
  move() {
    console.log("roaming the earth...");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark(times: number) {
    for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
      console.log("Woof!");
    }
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
//Base class method
dog.move();
//Sub class method
dog.bark(3);


//learn Overriding Methods
//A sub class can also override a base class field or property. You can use the "super." syntax to access base class methods.

//note that because JavaScript classes are a simple lookup object, there is no notion of a "super field".

//TypeScript enforces that a derived class is always a subtype of its base class.

//example, here's a legal way to override a method:
class Base {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello there!!");
  }
}

class subClass extends Base {
  greet(name?: string) {
    // if (name === undefined) {
    //   super.greet();
    // }else {
    //   console.log(`Hello, + ${name.toUpperCase()}`);
    // }
    //rewrite with ternary operator
    (name === undefined) ? super.greet() : console.log (`Hello, + ${name.toUpperCase()}`);
  }
}

const human = new subClass();
human.greet();
human.greet("Bobby");

//important It's important that a derived (sub)class follow its base class contract. Remember that it's very common (and always legal!) to refer to a derived class instance through a base class reference:
//Alias the derived subclass instance through a base class reference
const derived: Base = human;
//No problem
derived.greet();

////what if Derived didn't follow Base's contract?
//example
/*
class notFollowBase {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello there!!");
  }
}
class Derived extends notFollowBase {
  //Make this parameter required
  greet(name: string) {   //<== error
   //Property 'greet' in type 'Derived' is not assignable to the same property in base type 'Base'.
  //Type '(name: string) => void' is not assignable to type '() => void'.
  console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);
}
}
//If we compiled this code despite the error, this sample would then crash:
const b: Base = new Derived();
// Crashes because "name" will be undefined
b.greet();
*/

//note Type-only Field Declarations
//When target >= ES2022 or useDefineForClassFields is true, class fields are initialized after the parent class constructor completes, overwriting any value set by the parent class.
//This can be a problem when you only want to re-declare a more accurate type for an inherited field.
//To handle these cases, you can write declare to indicate to TypeScript that there should be no runtime effect for this field declaration.
//example
/*
interface Animal {  //<== can be use as : type
  dateOfBirth: any;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: any;
}

class AnimalHouse {
  resident: Animal;

  constructor(animal: Animal) {
    //use this. syntax to call class property assign to constructor's parameter name
    this.resident = animal;
  }
}

class DogHouse extends AnimalHouse {
  //does not emit JS code,
  //only ensures the types are correct
  declare resident: Dog;

  constructor(dog: Dog) {
    super(dog);
  }
}
*/

//note Initialization Order
//The order that JavaScript classes initialize can be surprising in some cases. Let's consider this code:
class initialOrderBase {
  name = "base";

  constructor() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
}

class Derived extends initialOrderBase {
  name = "derived";
}

//prints "base", not "derived"
const d = new Derived();
/*
What happened here?

The order of class initialization, as defined by JavaScript, is:

1. The base class fields are initialized
2. The base class constructor runs
3. The derived class fields are initialized
4. The derived class constructor runs

This means that the base class constructor saw its own value for name during its own constructor, because the derived class field initializations hadn't run yet.
*/

//note Inheriting Built-in Types

//note: If you don't plan to inherit from built-in types like Array, Error, Map, etc. or your compilation target is explicitly set to ES6/ES2015 or above, you may skip this section

//In ES2015, constructors which return an object implicitly substitute the value of this for any callers of super(...). It is necessary for generated constructor code to capture any potential return value of super(...) and replace it with this.

//As a result, subclassing Error, Array, and others may no longer work as expected. This is due to the fact that constructor functions for Error, Array, and the like use ECMAScript 6's new.target to adjust the prototype chain; however, there is no way to ensure a value for new.target when invoking a constructor in ECMAScript 5. Other downlevel compilers generally have the same limitation by default.

//example For a subclass like the following:
/*
class MsgError extends Error {
  constructor(m: string) {
    super(m);
  }
  sayHello() {
    return "hello " + this.message;
  }
}
*/

// you may find that:

//methods may be undefined on objects returned by constructing these subclasses, so calling sayHello will result in an error.

//instanceof will be broken between instances of the subclass and their instances, so (new MsgError()) instanceof MsgError will return false.

//As a recommendation, you can manually adjust the prototype immediately after any super(...) calls.
//example
class MsgError extends Error {
  constructor(m: string) {
    super(m);

    // Set the prototype explicitly.
    Object.setPrototypeOf(this, MsgError.prototype);
  }

  sayHello() {
    return "hello " + this.message;
  }
}
//However, any subclass of MsgError will have to manually set the prototype as well. For runtime that don't support Object.setPrototypeOf, you may instead be able to use __proto__.

//Unfortunately, these workarounds will not work on Internet Explorer 10 and prior. One can manually copy methods from the prototype onto the instance itself (i.e. MsgError.prototype onto this), but the prototype chain itself cannot be fixed.

//learn Member Visibility
//You can use TypeScript to control whether certain methods or properties are visible to code outside the class.

//note public: all
//The default visibility of class members is public. A public member can be accessed anywhere:
//example
class Greeter {
  public greet() {
    console.log("Hello")
  }
}

const nameForClass = new Greeter();
nameForClass.greet();
//Because public is already the default visibility modifier, you donâ€™t ever need to write it on a class member, but might choose to do so for style/readability reasons.

//note protected: sub-class
//protected members are only visible to subclasses of the class they're declared in.
class ProtectedGreeter {
  public greet() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.getName());
  }
  protected getName() {
    return "hi";
  }
}

class SpecialGreeter extends ProtectedGreeter {
  public howdy() {
    // OK to access protected member here
    console.log("Howdy, " + this.getName());
  }
}
const g = new SpecialGreeter();
g.greet(); // OK
g.getName(); //<== error
////Property 'getName' is protected and only accessible within class 'Greeter' and its subclasses.

//note Exposure of protected members

//Derived classes need to follow their base class contracts, but may choose to expose a subtype of base class with more capabilities. This includes making protected members public:
class ProtectedBase {
  protected m = 10;
}
class PublicDerived extends Base {
  // No modifier, so default is 'public'
  m = 15;
}
const d1 = new PublicDerived();
console.log(d1.m); // OK

//note that PublicDerived was already able to freely read and write m, so this doesn't meaningfully alter the "security" of this situation. The main thing to note here is that in the derived (sub)class, we need to be careful to repeat the protected modifier if this exposure isn't intentional.

//note Cross-hierarchy protected access

//Different OOP languages disagree about whether itâ€™s legal to access a protected member through a base class reference:
//example with error
/*
class CrossHierarchyBase {
  protected x: number = 1;
}
class Derived1 extends CrossHierarchyBase {
  protected x: number = 5;
}
class Derived2 extends CrossHierarchyBase {
  f1(other: Derived2) {
    other.x = 10;
  }
  f2(other: CrossHierarchyBase) {
    other.x = 10; //<== error
//Property 'x' is protected and only accessible through an instance of class 'Derived2'. This is an instance of class 'Base'.
  }
}
*/
/*
Java, for example, considers this to be legal. On the other hand, C# and C++ chose that this code should be illegal.

TypeScript sides with C# and C++ here, because accessing x in Derived2 should only be legal from Derived2's subclasses, and Derived1 isn't one of them. Moreover, if accessing x through a Derived1 reference is illegal (which it certainly should be!), then accessing it through a base class reference should never improve the situation.
*/

//note private: self only
//private is like protected, but doesn't allow access to the member even from subclasses:
//example with error
/*
class PrivateBase {
  private x = 0;
}
const b = new Base();
//can't access from the outside the class
console.log(b,x); //<==error
//Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.

class Derived2 extends PrivateBase {
showX() {
  //can't access in subclasses
  console.log(this.x); //<==error
  //Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.
}
}

//Because private members arenâ€™t visible to derived classes, a derived class canâ€™t increase its visibility:

class PrivateBase1 {
  private x = 0;
}
class Derived3 extends PrivateBase1 {
//Class 'Derived' incorrectly extends base class 'Base'.
  //Property 'x' is private in type 'Base' but not in type 'Derived'.
  x = 1;
}
*/

//note Cross-instance private access

//Different OOP languages disagree about whether different instances of the same class may access each others' private members. While languages like Java, C#, C++, Swift, and PHP allow this, Ruby does not.

//TypeScript does allow cross-instance private access:
class A {
  private x = 10;

  public sameAs(other: A) {
    //no error
    return other.x === this.x
  }
}

//note Caveats
//Like other aspects of TypeScript's type system, private and protected are only enforced during type checking.

//This means that JavaScript runtime constructs like in or simple property lookup can still access a private or protected member:
class MySafe {
  private secretKey = 12345;
}
// In a JavaScript file...
const s = new MySafe();
// Will print 12345
//console.log(s.secretKey); //<== error
//Property 'secretKey' is private and only accessible within class 'MySafe'.

//private also allows access using bracket notation during type checking. This makes private-declared fields potentially easier to access for things like unit tests, with the drawback that these fields are soft private and don't strictly enforce privacy.
// OK
console.log(s["secretKey"]);

//Unlike TypeScripts's private, JavaScript's private fields (#) remain private after compilation and do not provide the previously mentioned escape hatches like bracket notation access, making them hard private.
//example TyprScript:
class Doggy {
  #barkAmount = 0;
  personality = "happy";

  constructor() {}
}
//example JavaScript
// "use strict";
// class Doggy {
//     #barkAmount = 0;
//     personality = "happy";
//     constructor() { }
// }

//When compiling to ES2021 or less, TypeScript will use WeakMaps in place of #.
/*
"use strict";
var _Dog_barkAmount;
class Dog {
    constructor() {
        _Dog_barkAmount.set(this, 0);
        this.personality = "happy";
    }
}
_Dog_barkAmount = new WeakMap();
*/

//If you need to protect values in your class from malicious actors, you should use mechanisms that offer hard runtime privacy, such as closures, WeakMaps, or private fields.
//note that these added privacy checks during runtime could affect performance.


//learn Static Members

//Classes may have static members. These members aren't associated with a particular instance of the class. They can be accessed through the class constructor object itself:
//example
/*
class MyStaticClass {
  static x = 0;

  static printX() {
    console.log(MyClass.x); //<== error
  }
}
console.log(MyClass.x); //<== error
MyClass.printX(); //<== error
*/

//noteStatic members can also use the same public, protected, and private visibility modifiers:
/*
class MyStaticClass1 {
  private static x = 0;
}
console.log(MyClass.x); //<== error
//Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'MyClass'.
*/

//noteStatic members are also inherited:
//example
class StaticBase {
  static getGreeting() {
    return "Hello world";
  }
}
class StaticDerived extends StaticBase {
  myGreeting = StaticDerived.getGreeting();
}

//note Special Static Names

//It's generally not safe/possible to overwrite properties from the Function prototype. Because classes are themselves functions that can be invoked with new, certain static names can't be used. Function properties like name, length, and call aren't valid to define as static members:
/*
class S {
  static name = "S!"; //<== error
//Static property 'name' conflicts with built-in property 'Function.name' of constructor function 'S'.
}
*/

//learn Why No Static Classes?

//TypeScript (and JavaScript) don't have a construct called static class the same way as, for example, C# does.

//Those constructs only exist because those languages force all data and functions to be inside a class; because that restriction doesn't exist in TypeScript, there's no need for them.
//A class with only a single instance is typically just represented as a normal object in JavaScript/TypeScript.

//For example, we don't need a "static class" syntax in TypeScript because a regular object (or even top-level function) will do the job just as well:

// Unnecessary "static" class
class MyStaticClass {
  static doSomething() {}
}

// Preferred (alternative 1)
function doSomething() {}

// Preferred (alternative 2)
const MyHelperObject = {
  dosomething() {},
};

//note static Blocks in Classes
//Static blocks allow you to write a sequence of statements with their own scope that can access private fields within the containing class.
//This means that we can write initialization code with all the capabilities of writing statements, no leakage of variables, and full access to our class's internals.
//example
/*
class Foo {
    static #count = 0;

    get count() {
        return Foo.#count;
    }

    static {
        try {
            const lastInstances = loadLastInstances();
            Foo.#count += lastInstances.length;
        }
        catch {}
    }
}
*/

//learn Generic Classes
//Classes, much like interfaces, can be generic. When a generic class is instantiated with new, its type parameters are inferred the same way as in a function call:

class Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;

  constructor(value: Type) {
    this.contents = value;
  }
}

const b = new Box("hello!");
//const b: Box<string>  //<== result

//Classes can use generic constraints and defaults the same way as interfaces.

//note Type Parameters in Static Members

//This code isn't legal, and it may not be obvious why:
/*
class Box<Type> {
  static defaultValue: Type;  //<== error
//Static members cannot reference class type parameters.
}
*/

//Remember that types are always fully erased!
//At runtime, there's only one Box.defaultValue property slot.
//This means that setting Box<string>.defaultValue (if that were possible) would also change Box<number>.defaultValue - not good.
//The static members of a generic class can never refer to the class's type parameters.

//note this. at Runtime in Classes
//Itâ€™s important to remember that TypeScript doesnâ€™t change the runtime behavior of JavaScript, and that JavaScript is somewhat famous for having some peculiar runtime behaviors.

//JavaScriptâ€™s handling of this is indeed unusual:
class ThisMyClass {
  name = "MyClass";

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

const c = new ThisMyClass();

const obj = {
  name: "obj",
  getName: c.getName,
};

// Prints "obj", not "MyClass"
console.log(obj.getName());

//Long story short, by default, the value of this inside a function depends on how the function was called.
//In above example, because the function was called through the obj reference, its value of this was obj rather than the class instance.

//This is rarely what you want to happen!
//TypeScript provides some ways to mitigate or prevent this kind of error.

//note Arrow Function
//If you have a function that will often be called in a way that loses its this context, it can make sense to use an arrow function property instead of a method definition:
class ArrowFuncClass {
  name = "MyClass";

  getName = () => {
    return this.name;
  };
}
const c1 = new ArrowFuncClass();
const g1 = c1.getName;
// Prints "MyClass" instead of crashing
console.log(g1());

//note This has some trade-offs:

// The this. value is guaranteed to be correct at runtime, even for code not checked with TypeScript
//This will use more memory, because each class instance will have its own copy of each function defined this way
//You can't use super.getName in a derived class, because there's no entry in the prototype chain to fetch the base class method from

//note this parameters
/*
//In a method or function definition, an initial parameter named this has special meaning in TypeScript. These parameters are erased during compilation:
// TypeScript input with 'this' parameter
function fn(this: SomeType, x: number) {
 . . .
}

// JavaScript output
function fn(x) {
  . . .
}
*/

//TypeScript checks that calling a function with a this parameter is done so with a correct context.
//Instead of using an arrow function, we can add a this parameter to method definitions to statically enforce that the method is called correctly:
//example

class correctMyClass {
  name = "MyTestClass";

  getName(this: correctMyClass) {
    return this.name;
  }
}
const c5 = new correctMyClass();
// OK
c5.getName();
/*
// Error, would crash
const g = c.getName;
console.log(g());
//The 'this' context of type 'void' is not assignable to method's 'this' of type 'MyClass'.
*/

//note This method makes the opposite trade-offs of the arrow function approach:

//JavaScript callers might still use the class method incorrectly without realizing it
// Only one function per class definition gets allocated, rather than one per class instance
//Base method definitions can still be called via super.


//learn this Types
//In classes, a special type called this refers dynamically to the type of the current class. Let's see how this is useful:
class ThisBox {
  contents: string = "";
  set(value: string) {

    this.contents = value;
    return this;
  }
}

//Here, TypeScript inferred the return type of set to be this, rather than Box.
//Now let's make a subclass of Box:
class ClearableBox extends ThisBox {
  clear() {
    this.contents = "";
  }
}

const a5 = new ClearableBox();
const b5 = a5.set("hello, there");

//You can also use this in a parameter type annotation:
class AnotherBox {
  content: string = "";

  sameAs(other: this) {
    return other.content === this.content;
  }
}

//This is different from writing other: Box â€” if you have a derived class, its sameAs method will now only accept other instances of that same derived class:
class OtherBox {
  content: string = "";

  sameAs(other: this) {
    return other.content === this.content;
  }
}

class DerivedBox extends OtherBox {
  otherContent: string = "?";
}

const baseOther = new OtherBox();
const derivedOther = new DerivedBox();
derivedOther.sameAs(baseOther); //<== error
//Argument of type 'Box' is not assignable to parameter of type 'DerivedBox'.
  //Property 'otherContent' is missing in type 'Box' but required in type 'DerivedBox'.

  //note this-based type guards

//You can use this is Type in the return position for methods in classes and interfaces.
//When mixed with a type narrowing (e.g. if statements) the type of the target object would be narrowed to the specified Type.
//example
/*
class FileSystemObject {
  isFile(): this is FileRep {
    return this instanceof FileRep;
  }
  isDirectory(): this is Directory {
    return this instanceof Directory;
  }
  isNetworked(): this is Networked & this {
    return this.networked;
  }

  constructor(public path: string, private networked: boolean) {}
}

class FileRep extends FileSystemObject {
  constructor(path: string, public content: string) {
    super(path, false);
  }
}

class Directory extends FileSystemObject {
  children: FileSystemObject[];
}

interface Networked {
  host: string;
}

const fso: FileSystemObject = new FileRep("foo/bar.txt", "foo");

if (fso.isFile()) {
  fso.content;

const fso: FileRep
} else if (fso.isDirectory()) {
  fso.children;

const fso: Directory
} else if (fso.isNetworked()) {
  fso.host;

const fso: Networked & FileSystemObject
}
*/

//important A common use-case for a this-based type guard is to allow for lazy validation of a particular field.
//example, this case removes an undefined from the value held inside box when hasValue has been verified to be true:
class LazyValidationBox<T> {
  value?: T;

  hasValue(): this is { value: T } {
    return this.value !== undefined;
  }
}

const box = new LazyValidationBox();
box.value = "Gameboy";

box.value;
//(property) LazyValidationBox<unknown>.value?: unknown <==

if (box.hasValue()) {
  box.value;
//(property) value: unknown
}

//note Parameter Properties
//TypeScript offers special syntax for turning a constructor parameter into a class property with the same name and value.
//These are called parameter properties and are created by prefixing a constructor argument with one of the visibility modifiers public, private, protected, or readonly.
//The resulting field gets those modifier(s):
/*
class Params {
  constructor(
    public readonly x: number,
    protected y: number,
    private z: number
  ) {
    // No body necessary
  }
}
const a = new Params(1, 2, 3);
console.log(a.x);
//(property) Params.x: number

console.log(a.z); //<== error
//Property 'z' is private and only accessible within class 'Params'.
*/

//note Class Expressions
//Class expressions are very similar to class declarations. The only real difference is that class expressions don't need a name, though we can refer to them via whatever identifier they ended up bound to:
const someClass = class<Type> {
  content: Type;

  constructor(value: Type) {
    this.content = value;
  }
};

const m = new someClass("Hello, world");
//const m: someClass<string>

//note abstract Classes and Members
//Classes, methods, and fields in TypeScript may be abstract.

//An abstract method or abstract field is one that hasn't had an implementation provided. These members must exist inside an abstract class, which cannot be directly instantiated.

//The role of abstract classes is to serve as a base class for subclasses which do implement all the abstract members. When a class doesnâ€™t have any abstract members, it is said to be concrete.

//example:

abstract class AbstractBase {
  abstract getName(): string;

  printName() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.getName());
  }
}

//const b6 = new AbstractBase(); //<== error
//Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.

//We can't instantiate Base with new because it's abstract. Instead, we need to make a derived class and implement the abstract members:
class AbstractDerived extends AbstractBase {
  getName() {
    return "world";
  }
}

const d6 = new AbstractDerived();
d6.printName();

//Notice that if we forget to implement the base class's abstract members, we'll get an error:
//example with error
/*
class AbstractDerived1 extends AbstractBase {
  //Non-abstract class 'Derived' does not implement inherited abstract member 'getName' from class 'Base'.

    // forgot to do anything
  }
*/

//note Abstract Construct Signatures

//Sometimes you want to accept some class constructor function that produces an instance of a class which derives from some abstract class.
/*
//example, you might want to write this code:
function greet(ctor: typeof AbstractBase) {
  const instance = new ctor(); //<== error
//Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.

  instance.printName();
}
*/

//TypeScript is correctly telling you that youâ€™re trying to instantiate an abstract class.
//After all, given the definition of greet, itâ€™s perfectly legal to write this code, which would end up constructing an abstract class:
//bad
//greet(AbstractBase)

//Instead, you want to write a function that accepts something with a construct signature:
/*
function greet(ctor: new () => AbstractBase) {
  const instance = new ctor();
  instance.printName();
}
greet(AbstractDerived); //<==error
greet(AbstractBase); //<== error
//Argument of type 'typeof Base' is not assignable to parameter of type 'new () => Base'.
  //Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.
*/

//Now TypeScript correctly tells you about which class constructor functions can be invoked - Derived can because it's concrete, but Base cannot

//note Relationships Between Classes
//In most cases, classes in TypeScript are compared structurally, the same as other types.

//example, these two classes can be used in place of each other because they're identical:
class Point1 {
  x = 0;
  y = 0;
}

class Point2 {
  x = 0;
  y = 0;
}

// OK
const p: Point1 = new Point2();

//Similarly, subtype relationships between classes exist even if there's no explicit inheritance:
/*
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

class Employee {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  salary: number;
}

// OK
const p7: Person = new Employee();
*/

//This sounds straightforward, but there are a few cases that seem stranger than others.

//Empty classes have no members. In a structural type system, a type with no members is generally a supertype of anything else. So if you write an empty class (don't!), anything can be used in place of it:
//Example
/*
class Empty {}

function fn(x: Empty) {
  // can't do anything with 'x', so I won't
}

// All OK!
fn(window);
fn({});
fn(fn);
*/
